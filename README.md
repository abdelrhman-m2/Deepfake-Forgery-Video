# 🎭 DeepFake Video Detector 🎬

---

## 🧠 What is This Project?

This is a Deep Learning-based web app that **detects deepfake videos** using an **LSTM-based neural network** trained on frame sequences. It helps users identify manipulated videos with a **confidence score**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **Deep Learning**: Advanced neural network using LSTM and CNN.
- 📱 **Mobile Optimized**: Efficient MobileNetV2 as the CNN backbone.
- 🎬 **Video Analysis**: Processes sequential frames from uploaded videos.
- ⚡ **Fast Processing**: Quickly analyzes short videos (up to 8 seconds).
- 🔍 **High Accuracy**: Trained on a real/fake face dataset.
- 📊 **Confidence Score**: Shows probability-based results.
